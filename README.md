Schuster is a multinational retailer of sporting goods and accessories. Schuster maintains significant business relationships with hundreds of suppliers with whom we have credit agreements. Unfortunately, not all providers adhere to the terms and conditions of their loans, and some are prone to late payments. Schuster charges high fees for late payments, and this approach is not beneficial to either party in a long-term business relationship. Some office workers are always looking for suppliers who will receive their payments on time. However, this approach also leads to non-value-added activities, loss of time, and financial implications. Therefore, Schuster attempts to understand the payment behavior of its customers and predict the likelihood of late payments on outstanding invoices.

To understand how to approach this problem using data science, let's first look at Schuster's payment process. Every time a product transaction occurs with a supplier, the accounting team creates and sends an invoice to the supplier. This invoice contains information about the products, amount invoiced, date of creation, and payment term, according to the credit terms of the contract. Transactions with these providers are very common. Therefore, each supplier is always assigned multiple invoices.

**GOAL: **
Schuster wants to better understand their customers' payment behavior based on their previous payment behavior (customer segmentation). The company wants to be able to use historical information to predict how likely a customer will be late in paying an outstanding invoice. This information is intended to proactively contact customers in order to receive payments on time and to help debt collectors prioritize their work. 
In summary, a business analyst wants to find answers to the following questions: 
 
1- How can you analyze customer transaction data to identify different payment behaviors? 
2- How can we differentiate between customers based on their past payment patterns and behavior? 
3- Can we use historical data to predict the likelihood that a customer will be late in paying an outstanding invoice? 
4- The model we developed Can you gain business insights based on?
